Comparing different decision tree algorithms for the FashionMINST classification problem

I compare:

- Regular decision trees, accounting for seed dependency
- Random forests
- Scikit's bagging algorithm
- XGboost

Contrary to popular belief, trees do give a pretty good classification accuracy, up to 90%!
